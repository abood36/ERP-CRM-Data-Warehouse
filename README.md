# ERP-CRM-Data-Warehouse
  A complete Data Engineering pipeline built using SQL Server and Python, designed to collect, process, and analyze large-scale datasets efficiently.

  The goal of this project is to showcase strong data engineering practices ‚Äî from data ingestion and transformation to storage optimization and analytics-ready data modeling.


## üß† Project Overview
  This project demonstrates a complete Data Engineering pipeline built using SQL Server and Python, designed to collect, process, and analyze large-scale datasets efficiently.
  
  The goal of this project is to showcase strong data engineering practices ‚Äî from data ingestion and transformation to storage optimization and analytics-ready data modeling.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
  Python: For data extraction, transformation, and automation (using libraries such as pandas, pyodbc, and sqlalchemy).
  
  SQL Server: As the main data warehouse for structured data storage and complex querying.
  
  ETL Framework: Custom-built ETL scripts to automate data workflows.
  
  Data Modeling: Implemented star schema / normalized models for analytics and reporting.
  
  Logging & Error Handling: Implemented structured logs and exception handling for production-grade reliability.


## üöÄ Key Features
  Automated ETL Pipeline: Extracts data from multiple sources (CSV, APIs, or raw databases) and loads it into SQL Server tables.
  
  Data Cleaning & Validation: Applies transformation rules in Python to ensure high data quality and consistency.
  
  Efficient SQL Queries: Optimized stored procedures and indexing strategies for performance.
  
  Scalable Architecture: Modular and extendable design ready for integration with orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow or Azure Data Factory).
  
  Reporting Layer: Prepared analytical views for BI tools such as Power BI or Tableau.


## üìä Example Use Case
  For demonstration, the project simulates a Sales & Customer Analytics pipeline:
  Raw data ingestion from CSV/API sources.
  
  Data transformation and cleaning using Python scripts.
  
  Loading into SQL Server staging and fact/dimension tables.
  
  Generating KPIs and business insights through SQL queries.
